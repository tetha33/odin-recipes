    <h2>Apple Pie Recipe</h2>
    <p>Apple pie is a classic dessert that has become a symbol of comfort and tradition, especially in American and European homes. Made with a buttery, flaky crust and a warm, spiced apple filling, it's a treat that's both simple and satisfying. The filling usually consists of sliced apples mixed with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and sometimes a touch of lemon juice or vanilla for added depth. Once the filling is placed inside the crust, a top layer—either a full crust or a lattice pattern—is added before baking.</p>
    <p>As it bakes, the pie fills the kitchen with a sweet, inviting aroma that signals home and family. Apple pie is often served warm, either plain or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. Though many enjoy it during fall or holiday gatherings, it's a year-round favorite for many. Whether made from scratch or with store-bought crust, a good apple pie balances tart and sweet flavors and delivers that unmistakable homemade touch.</p>
