    <h2>Pizza Recipe</h2>
    <p>Making pizza at home is a rewarding and creative process that starts with preparing the dough. A good pizza dough typically requires just a few basic ingredients—flour, water, yeast, salt, and a bit of olive oil—but it's the kneading and rising that give it its texture and flavor. After allowing the dough to rise, it is rolled out and shaped by hand or with a rolling pin, depending on how thick or thin you like your crust. The smell of fresh dough alone can make the kitchen feel like an Italian pizzeria.</p>
    <p>Once the dough is ready, the fun part begins: topping the pizza. A classic base starts with tomato sauce, followed by a generous layer of mozzarella cheese. From there, you can customize with virtually any toppings you like—pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, or even pineapple. After assembling the pizza, it’s baked in a hot oven, typically at 475–500°F (245–260°C), until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling. In the end, you get a hot, crispy, and flavorful slice of homemade comfort food.</p>
