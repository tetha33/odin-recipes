    <h2>Sarmale Recipe</h2>
    <p>Romanian sarma, known locally as sarmale, is one of Romania’s most beloved and iconic traditional dishes. It features pickled cabbage leaves stuffed with a mixture of minced pork (sometimes blended with beef), rice, onions, herbs, and spices like dill and thyme. The rolls are layered in a large pot with pieces of smoked meat, sauerkraut, and sometimes tomato juice or paste, then simmered slowly for several hours. This slow cooking process allows the flavors to develop deeply, resulting in a tender, savory dish that's rich, filling, and comforting.</p>
    <p>Sarmale is especially popular during holidays and celebrations, most notably Christmas, Easter, and weddings. It’s often served with mămăligă (Romanian-style polenta), a dollop of sour cream, and a hot chili pepper on the side. While every Romanian family has its own variation, the essence of sarmale lies in its deep connection to Romanian heritage, hospitality, and home-cooked warmth. It's more than just a meal—it’s a symbol of tradition passed down through generations.</p>
